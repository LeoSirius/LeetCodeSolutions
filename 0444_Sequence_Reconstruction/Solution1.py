# Check whether the original sequence org can be uniquely reconstructed from 
# the sequences in seqs. 
# The org sequence is a permutation of the integers from 1 to n, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 104.
#  Reconstruction means building a shortest common supersequence of the
#   sequences in seqs (i.e., a shortest sequence so that all sequences in seqs are
#    subsequences of it). Determine whether there is only one sequence that can be 
#    reconstructed from seqs and it is the org sequence.

# Example 1:
# Input: org = [1,2,3], seqs = [[1,2],[1,3]]
# Output: false
# Explanation: [1,2,3] is not the only one sequence that can be reconstructed, because [1,3,2] is also a valid sequence that can be reconstructed.

# Example 2:
# Input: org = [1,2,3], seqs = [[1,2]]
# Output: false
# Explanation: The reconstructed sequence can only be [1,2].

# Example 3:
# Input: org = [1,2,3], seqs = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
# Output: true
# Explanation: The sequences [1,2], [1,3], and [2,3] can uniquely reconstruct the original sequence [1,2,3].

# Example 4:
# Input: org = [4,1,5,2,6,3], seqs = [[5,2,6,3],[4,1,5,2]]
# Output: true

# Constraints:
# 1 <= n <= 10^4
# org is a permutation of {1,2,...,n}.
# seqs[i][j] fits in a 32-bit signed integer.
